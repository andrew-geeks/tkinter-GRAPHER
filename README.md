The project(software) is published with a primary account with email:admin@cms.com and password:cms2020. You can login with these credentials or create a new one. We have used matplotlib library to project subject scores. We have created a class known as 12A. When a class is made, a new database is made. After entering to your class you can see your classprofile which includes tables of student details and subject details with marks and percentiles. You can add marks through 'Add Marks function' or by uploading the marksheet csv file. You can save the marksheet from the software and enter the marks and then upload it. Note: Please do not change the format of the the csv(marksheet) file as the program may go wrong. Refresh function is used to update details to the front end. Your class should contain 5 subjects. You can view individual subjects marks from the profile panel.
