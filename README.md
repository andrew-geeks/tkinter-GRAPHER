# tkinter-Class-Management-System
A python software fully developed by me. It can be used for daily activities of a teacher(tutor). It has exciting features like plotting graphs, percentage calculator, saving details of students in databases etc.
It helps to plot graphs like Pie Chart & Bar Graph for student projection and class projection(in version 1.2).
You can create an acount in the software and add your class.

HOW TO USE:
Download all the files and save it in one folder. Run the cms-main.py file.
The project(software) is published with a primary account with email:admin@cms.com and password:cms2020. You can login with these credentials or create a new one. We have used matplotlib library to project subject scores. We have created a class known as 12A. When a class is made, a new database is made. After entering to your class you can see your classprofile which includes tables of student details and subject details with marks and percentiles. You can add marks through 'Add Marks function' or by uploading the marksheet csv file. You can save the marksheet from the software and enter the marks and then upload it. Note: Please do not change the format of the the csv(marksheet) file as the program may go wrong. Refresh function is used to update details to the front end. Your class should contain 5 subjects. You can view individual subjects marks from the profile panel. In the coming versions(1.2 and 1.3) we will be adding new features. Stay tuned!!
